# Scrimba React Basics: Markdown Notes App

## Overview
This project is a Markdown Notes App built with React, as part of Scrimba's React Basics course. It demonstrates key React concepts and provides a functional platform for creating and managing markdown notes.

## Important Notes
- **React Version**: The app is developed using React version 17. This is due to compatibility issues with one of the libraries, `react-mde`, which is not supported beyond React 17. The app is intended for learning purposes.

# Scrimba React Starter Template

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
