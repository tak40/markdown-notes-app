# Scrimba React Basics: Markdown Notes App

## Overview
This project is a Markdown Notes App built with React, as part of Scrimba's React Basics course. It demonstrates key React concepts and provides a functional platform for creating and managing markdown notes.

## Important Notes
- **React Version**: The app is developed using React version 17. This is due to compatibility issues with one of the libraries, `react-mde`, which is not supported beyond React 17. The app is intended for learning purposes.

### Understanding the Rendering Process and File Connections

#### Overview
The Markdown Notes App starts with `index.js` as the entry point, which is responsible for rendering the `App` component into the DOM. The `App` component acts as the orchestrator, managing the application's state and logic, and includes the child components `Editor` and `Sidebar`.

#### Rendering Process
- **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application. It mounts the `App` component to the root DOM node in the HTML using `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))`.
- **`App` Component**: Manages the application's state and logic. It renders child components `Editor` and `Sidebar` as part of its output (JSX).
- **Child Components**: `Editor` and `Sidebar` are responsible for defining their own UI. They receive data and callback functions as props from `App`.

#### Reactâ€™s Role
React oversees the rendering process, translating the JSX from `App` (including `Sidebar` and `Editor`) into actual DOM elements. This integrated UI is displayed in the web browser.

### Guidelines for Understanding React Codebase

When approaching a React codebase, especially for the first time, it's important to have a systematic approach. Here are some general guidelines to help you understand the structure and functionality of React components:
git 
1. **Component Structure and JSX**: Begin by examining the JSX layout to grasp the component's structure. Look for how child components are nested and integrated.
   - **Component Layout**: Identify the layout and arrangement of elements within the JSX.
   - **Child Components**: Note any child components and how they are incorporated into the JSX.

2. **State and Props Analysis**: Understand the state variables - what dynamic data they represent, their initial values, and how they're used in the component. Also, observe how props are passed and utilized.
   - **State Variables**: Review any state variables declared (e.g., with `useState`) and their roles in the component.
   - **Props Usage**: Examine how props are received from parent components and passed to child components.

3. **Functionality and Event Handling**: Focus on the functions within the component. These might include event handlers, state update logic, and other behavior-defining code.
   - **Event Handlers**: Identify functions that handle user interactions (e.g., clicks, form submissions).
   - **State Updates**: Pay attention to how and when the state is updated in response to events or user actions.

This approach offers a structured pathway to analyze and comprehend React components, setting a strong foundation for exploring specific components in the application.

# Scrimba React Starter Template

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
