# Scrimba React Basics: Markdown Notes App

## Overview

This project is a Markdown Notes App built with React, as part of Scrimba's React Basics course. It demonstrates key React concepts and provides a functional platform for creating and managing markdown notes.

## Important Notes

-   **React Version**: The app is developed using React version 17. This is due to compatibility issues with one of the libraries, `react-mde`, which is not supported beyond React 17. The app is intended for learning purposes.

### Understanding the Rendering Process and File Connections

#### Overview

The Markdown Notes App starts with `index.js` as the entry point, which is responsible for rendering the `App` component into the DOM. The `App` component acts as the orchestrator, managing the application's state and logic, and includes the child components `Editor` and `Sidebar`.

#### Rendering Process

-   **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application. It mounts the `App` component to the root DOM node in the HTML using `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))`.
-   **`App` Component**: Manages the application's state and logic. It renders child components `Editor` and `Sidebar` as part of its output (JSX).
-   **Child Components**: `Editor` and `Sidebar` are responsible for defining their own UI. They receive data and callback functions as props from `App`.

#### Reactâ€™s Role

React oversees the rendering process, translating the JSX from `App` (including `Sidebar` and `Editor`) into actual DOM elements. This integrated UI is displayed in the web browser.

### Guidelines for Understanding React Codebase

When approaching a React codebase, especially for the first time, it's important to have a systematic approach. Here are some general guidelines to help you understand the structure and functionality of React components:

1. **Component Structure and JSX**: Begin by examining the JSX layout to grasp the component's structure. Look for how child components are nested and integrated.

    - **Component Layout**: Identify the layout and arrangement of elements within the JSX.
    - **Child Components**: Note any child components and how they are incorporated into the JSX.

2. **State and Props Analysis**: Understand the state variables - what dynamic data they represent, their initial values, and how they're used in the component. Also, observe how props are passed and utilized.

    - **State Variables**: Review any state variables declared (e.g., with `useState`) and their roles in the component.
    - **Props Usage**: Examine how props are received from parent components and passed to child components.

3. **Functionality and Event Handling**: Focus on the functions within the component. These might include event handlers, state update logic, and other behavior-defining code.
    - **Event Handlers**: Identify functions that handle user interactions (e.g., clicks, form submissions).
    - **State Updates**: Pay attention to how and when the state is updated in response to events or user actions.

This approach offers a structured pathway to analyze and comprehend React components, setting a strong foundation for exploring specific components in the application.

### Sync Notes with localStorage

![Using localStorage](/public/localStorage.png)

-   Resource:
    [Understanding `localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

`localStorage` is a way to store information on the user's computer. Unlike data stored in variables that disappear when you close your app, `localStorage` keeps the data even after closing the browser. This is how we use it:

-   **Value Constraints**: The `localStorage` only accepts strings as values. Therefore, if we want to store objects or arrays, we need to convert them into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify`. When retrieving the data, we convert it back to a JavaScript object or array with `JSON.parse`.

-   **Storing Items**: To store data, we use `localStorage.setItem("key", value)`. It's important to understand that `localStorage` works with key-value pairs:

    -   The "key" is a unique identifier for the data we want to store.
    -   The "value" is the data we want to store, which must be a string.

        ```javascript
        // Storing an object as a string
        const notesObject = { ... };
        localStorage.setItem("notes", JSON.stringify(notesObject));
        ```

-   **Retrieving Items**: To retrieve data, we use `localStorage.getItem("key")`. This method returns the data as a string, which we can then convert back to its original format using `JSON.parse` if necessary.

    ```javascript
    // Retrieving the object from localStorage
    // Since we stored it as a string, we know we need to parse it back into an object
    const storedNotes = localStorage.getItem('notes')

    // If 'storedNotes' is truthy, it means we have retrieved our notes data as a string
    // We then parse it to convert back to an object (or array if that's what you stored)
    // If 'storedNotes' is null (falsy), it means no data was found for "notes",
    // so we default to an empty array (or another suitable default state)
    const notes = storedNotes ? JSON.parse(storedNotes) : []
    ```

When implementing `localStorage` in a React app, we use the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects:

1. **Store Item**: We use `useEffect` to listen for changes in our state and update `localStorage` accordingly. The dependency array `[notes]` tells React to run the effect only when `notes` changes.

    ```javascript
    React.useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(notes))
    }, [notes])
    ```

2. **Get Item**: We retrieve and initialize our state with the stored data when the component mounts. If there's no stored item, we default to an empty array `[]`.

    ```javascript
    const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
        JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes')) || []
    )
    ```

This setup ensures our notes are saved across browser sessions and are retrieved when the app loads.

#### Lazy Initialization of State

In React, `useState` allows for lazy initialization, where the initial state is only set on the initial render of the component. This prevents expensive operations from being run on every render.

For instance, when we retrieve notes from `localStorage`, we only want to do this once when the component mounts:

```javascript
const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
    () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes')) || []
)
```

In this code:

-   `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes"))` is the potentially expensive operation (e.g., accessing `localStorage` and parsing JSON).
-   Wrapping this operation in a function `() => ...` ensures it's only called when the component mounts.
-   If `localStorage` returns `null`, indicating no saved notes, we default to an empty array [].

This pattern is especially useful when the initial state depends on computations such as parsing JSON from `localStorage` or fetching data from an API. It improves performance by avoiding unnecessary work on re-renders.

### Add Note Summary Titles

One of the enhancements in our Markdown Notes App is displaying the first line of each note's content as its summary title in the sidebar. This makes it easier for users to identify and select their notes. Here's how this feature was implemented:

#### Identifying the Update Location

The update takes place in the `Sidebar` component, specifically within the mapping of `notes` to `noteElements`. We changed how each note's title is displayed in the sidebar.

-   **Before Update**: Originally, the sidebar displayed a generic title for each note.

    ```javascript
    <h4 className="text-snippet">Note {index + 1}</h4>
    ```

-   **After Update**: We modified this line to display the first line of the note's content instead.

    ```javascript
    <h4 className="text-snippet">{note.body.split('\n')[0]}</h4>
    ```

#### Explanation of the Change

- **Using JavaScript in JSX**: By embedding a JavaScript expression within `{}`, we can dynamically insert the first line of each note.
- **The `note.body` Property**: This holds the text content of the note. We use `.split('\n')` to divide this text into an array of lines.
- **Selecting the First Line**: The expression `note.body.split('\n')[0]` gets the first element of the array, which is the first line of the note, and displays it as the title.


### Move Modified Notes to the Top of the List

One of the intuitive features of our Markdown Notes App is that when a user edits a note, the note is automatically moved to the top of the list. This section explains the rationale and the implementation details of this feature.

#### Understanding the User Edit Trigger

The first step in implementing this feature is to identify where in the code a note is being edited. This action typically occurs in a function that handles the update of a note's content. In our application, this is managed by the `updateNote` function. This function is crucial as it determines not only the update of the note's content but also the opportunity to change the note's position in the list.

#### Changing the Order of Notes

After identifying the edited note, the next step is to change the order of the notes. The goal is to move the edited note to the top of the list while maintaining the order of the other notes. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the edited note.
2. Create a new array where the edited note is placed at the beginning.
3. Add the remaining notes to this array, excluding the recently edited note.

#### Implementation

Here's how we implemented this feature:

- **In the `updateNote` Function**:
  - We iterate over the array of notes.
  - When we find the note being edited (identified by `oldNote.id === currentNoteId`), we update its content and use the `unshift` method to add this note to the beginning of a new array.
  - For all other notes, we use the `push` method to add them to this new array, ensuring the order is preserved.

    ```javascript
    function updateNote(text) {
        setNotes(oldNotes => {
            const newArray = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < oldNotes.length; i++) {
                const oldNote = oldNotes[i];
                if (oldNote.id === currentNoteId) {
                    newArray.unshift({ ...oldNote, body: text });
                } else {
                    newArray.push(oldNote);
                }
            }
            return newArray;
        });
    }
    ```

This functionality enhances the user experience by ensuring that the most recently interacted-with note is easily accessible and prominent in the list.
