# Scrimba React Basics: Markdown Notes App

## Overview
This project is a Markdown Notes App built with React, as part of Scrimba's React Basics course. It demonstrates key React concepts and provides a functional platform for creating and managing markdown notes.

## Important Notes
- **React Version**: The app is developed using React version 17. This is due to compatibility issues with one of the libraries, `react-mde`, which is not supported beyond React 17. The app is intended for learning purposes.

### Understanding the Codebase

#### Overview
The Markdown Notes App is structured with `index.js` as the entry point, which plays a pivotal role in initiating the rendering of the entire application. The key components in this application are `App`, `Editor`, and `Sidebar`.

#### Rendering Process
- **`index.js`**: This is the entry point of the application. It is responsible for rendering the `App` component into the DOM. It calls `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))`, which mounts the `App` component to the root DOM node in the HTML.

- **`App` Component**: `App` acts as the orchestrator for the entire application. It manages the application's state and logic, and includes child components `Editor` and `Sidebar` in its output (JSX). `App` is responsible for gathering all the necessary information and components, preparing them to be rendered onto the screen.

- **Child Components (`Editor` and `Sidebar`)**: These components are responsible for defining their own UI and local behavior. They receive data and callback functions as props from the `App` component. Their primary role is to define what their part of the UI should look like, based on the props they receive.

- **Reactâ€™s Role**: React oversees the rendering process. It takes the JSX from `App` (which includes `Sidebar` and `Editor`) and translates it into actual DOM elements. This process integrates the UI definitions of all components into a cohesive whole, displayed in the web browser.

#### Summary
In summary, the Markdown Notes App starts with `index.js` rendering `App`, which in turn organizes and includes `Editor` and `Sidebar`. Each component has its role, with `Editor` and `Sidebar` focusing on their own UI based on props from `App`. React then renders this entire structure into the DOM, resulting in the visible interface of the app.

# Scrimba React Starter Template

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
